## What versions of HTML:
* HTML 4 released in 1997.
* XHTML 1.0 released in 2000.
* HTML 5 released in 2000
Each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last (with new elements and attributes added and older code removed).
### DOCTYPES
Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included).
 ### DOCTYPE Example :
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Title of the document</title>
</head>

<body>
The content of the document......
</body>

</html>

### Attributes:

* id attribute:it is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.
* class attribute:it is used to specifies one or more class names for an element.
### Process and Design
It's important to understand some qousetions:
 1. who are your target ?
 2. what information they want to find ?
 3. why they would visit to your site?
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information thatwill need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication.
*  Visual hierarchy helpsvisitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
