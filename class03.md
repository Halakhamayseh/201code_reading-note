### Overflowing Content overflow
The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:
1. hidden
``This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.``
2. scroll
``This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content. On the left, you can see two boxes whose contents expand beyond their set dimensions. The first example has the overflow property with a value of hidden. The second example has the overflow property with a value of scroll.``
### Border, Margin& Padding
* Border
``Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another`` [link](https://wtf.tw/ref/duckett.pdf) and we can change border style
* Margin
``Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.``
* Padding [link](https://wtf.tw/ref/duckett.pdf)
``Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.``[link](https://wtf.tw/ref/duckett.pdf)

### USING IF … ELSE STATEMENTS
Here you can see that an if … e1se statement allows you to provide two sets of code:
* one set if the condition evaluates to true.
* another set if the condition is false.
### switch statement
switch statements do the  same task that else if statements do. But use switch statements when conditions are more. In that case, switch statements perform better than else if  statements,witch evaluates the expression and checks whether it matches with any case. If it matches with any case then statements within that case construct are executed followed by break statement. break statement makes sure that no more case statement gets executed, In case if the expression doesn't match any case value then default case is executed.
