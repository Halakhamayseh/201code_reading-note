# HTML list
* Ordered lists (< ol >) are lists where each item in the list is numbered.
* Unordered lists (< ul >) are lists that begin with a bullet point.
* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms.
## HTML boxes
* Box Dimensions width, height
* Limiting Width min-width, max-width
* Limiting height min-height, max-height
* Overflowing Content overflow
1. hidden
``This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.``
2. scroll
``This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content. On the left, you can see two boxes whose contents expand beyond their set dimensions. The first example has the overflow property with a value of hidden. The second example has the overflow property with a value of scroll.``
Border, Margin& Padding
Border
``Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another`` and we can change border style
Margin
``Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.``
Padding
``Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.``
