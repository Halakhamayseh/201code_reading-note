# html
 what link in html ?
A link ( short for hyperlink ) is an HTML object that allows you to jump to a new location when you click or tap it . Links are created using the (tag a tag) element. Users can click on anything between the opening "tag a tag" and the closing "tag /a tag". You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
href : The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link

Absolute URLs :  This is the web address that you would type into a browser if you wanted to visit that specific page.

Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site : You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.
### Relative URLs  : help when building a site on your computer because you can create links between pages without having to set up your domain  name or  hosting.
 ### What does layout ?
 layouts provide a way to arrange web pages in well-mannered , well-structured , and in responsive form or we can say that HTML layout specifies a way in which the web pages can be arranged . Web-page layout works with arrangement of visual elements of an HTML document.
layouts types
* process
* product
* hybrid
* fixed position.
### funcation
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
* declaring a function
To create a function , you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.
* calling function
declared the function , you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code .
### object
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
# Reasons for Pair Programming
* Greater efficiency In  reality , when two people focus on the same code base , it is easier to catch mistakes in the making .  Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging, when the pair is stuck, both programmers can research the problem and reach a solution faster.

* Engaged collaboration  When two programmers focus on the same code , the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. Another important aspect of learning to program is knowing when to ask for help. We advise our students to spend no more than fifteen minutes stuck on a problem before asking a teaching assistant or instructor for help.

* Learning from  fellow students Everyone has a different approach to  problem solving;  working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.

* Social skills  Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style , communication is key. This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities. Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills. When just grabbing the keyboard and taking over isn’t an option, getting good at finding the right words is a skill unto itself.

* Job interview  readiness a common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant , either in person or through a shared screen. They will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base. By doing so, companies can get a better feel for how an applicant will fit into the team and their collaboration style.

* Work environment readiness  Many companies  that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground  running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
