## Chapter 16:Images
Controlling the size and alignment of our images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of our page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.
### How can we control the size of an  image
* We can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS.
* In the CSS, you add selectors for each of the class names, then use the CSS width and height properties to control the image dimensions.
### Aligning images in css 
 There are two ways tha this is commonly achieved:
1. The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.
2. New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page. 
 ### Centering images :
1. On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.
2. On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.
### background-image
The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.
#### Repeating Images :

1. horizontally by (repeat-x)

3. repeat
4. no-repeat
#### The background-attachment 
1. fixed  The background image stays in the same position on the page.
2. scroll The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.
