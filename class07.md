## Domain Modeling  :
Domain modeling  is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem . A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain . An entity that stores data in properties and  encapsulates behaviors in methods is  commonly referred to as an  object-oriented mode
Tables
## What is a Table?
A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports,

## Basic Table  Structure
* < table > The < table >  element is used to create a table . The contents of the table are written out row by row.

* < tr >  You indicate the start of each row using the opening < tr > tag . (The tr stands for table row.) It is followed by one or more < td > elements (one for each cell in that row). At the end of the row you use a closing  < /tr > tag.

* < td >  Each cell of a table is represented using a < td > element . (The td stands for table data.) At the end of each cell you use a closing < /td > tag
Funchtion , Method , Object :

## Creating  an object :

Constructor notation The new keyword and the object constructor create a blank object You can then add properties and methods to the object.

Updating  an object To  update the value of properties, use dot notation or square brackets. To delete a property, use the delete keyword.

### Object  : objects are made up of properties and methods

###Fuctions and Method :

*Functions : consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task*

*Declaring a function : to create a function  , you give it a name then write the statments needed to achieve its task inside the curly barces.*

*Calling a function :having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly  braces with ust one line of code .*
*FUNCTION : is very  helpfull it’s has many benefits , avoid duplicated and it’s reusable (created ones and use it many times.*
 8Method : same function defintion but in it inside the object.*
