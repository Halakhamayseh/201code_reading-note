## How to set Headings,paragraphs,structural and semantic markup,bold, italic and emphasis.
### Markup
* Structure markup : the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.
* Semantic markup : which provides extra information , such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence.
 ### Headings
 ```HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least. For example:<H1>This is a top level heading</H1> Here is some text <H2>Second level heading</H2> Here is some more text.```[link](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/headings.html).
### paragraph
To create a paragraph, link related words to gather to make it, with an opening < p >
tag and closing < /p > tag.
### Bold, italic
* <b> **Make a text bold**
* <i> *Make a text italic*

### Superscript and Subscrip
`The sup element is used
to contain characters that should be superscript suchas the suffixes of dates ormathematical concepts likeraising a number to a power such as 22
The sub element is used to contain characters that shouldbe subscript. It is commonlyused with foot notes or chemicalformulas such as H20`[link](https://wtf.tw/ref/duckett.pdf)
# What CSS
CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
### BLOCK and INLINE ELEMENTS
### Block elements:
* ``A block-level element always starts on a new line.``
* ``A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).``
* ``A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.``
### inline element:
* ``An inline element does not start on a new line.``
* ``An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.``

``Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
X Declarations are made up of two parts: the propertiesof the element that you want to change, and the valuesof those properties. For example, the font-familyproperty sets the choice of font, and the value arialspecifies Arial as the preferred typeface.`` [link](https://wtf.tw/ref/duckett.pdf)
