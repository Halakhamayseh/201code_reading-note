## How to set Headings,paragraphs,structural and semantic markup,bold, italic and emphasis.
### Markup
* Structure markup : the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.
* Semantic markup : which provides extra information , such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence.
 ### Headings
 ```HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least. For example:<H1>This is a top level heading</H1> Here is some text <H2>Second level heading</H2> Here is some more text.```[link](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/headings.html).
