# Html
## How to set Headings,paragraphs,structural and semantic markup,bold, italic and emphasis.
### Markup
* Structure markup : the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.
* Semantic markup : which provides extra information , such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence.
 ### Headings
 ```HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least. For example:<H1>This is a top level heading</H1> Here is some text <H2>Second level heading</H2> Here is some more text.```[link](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/headings.html).
### paragraph
To create a paragraph, link related words to gather to make it, with an opening < p >
tag and closing < /p > tag.
### Bold, italic
* <b> **Make a text bold**
* <i> *Make a text italic*

### Superscript and Subscrip
`The sup element is used
to contain characters that should be superscript suchas the suffixes of dates ormathematical concepts likeraising a number to a power such as 22
The sub element is used to contain characters that shouldbe subscript. It is commonlyused with foot notes or chemicalformulas such as H20`[link](https://wtf.tw/ref/duckett.pdf)
# What CSS
CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
### BLOCK and INLINE ELEMENTS
### Block elements:
* ``A block-level element always starts on a new line.``
* ``A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).``
* ``A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.``
### inline element:
* ``An inline element does not start on a new line.``
* ``An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.``

``Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
 Declarations are made up of two parts: the propertiesof the element that you want to change, and the valuesof those properties. For example, the font-familyproperty setsthe choice of font, and the value arialspecifies Arial as the preferred typeface.`` [link](https://wtf.tw/ref/duckett.pdf)
# JavaScript
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers(5,2), strings(""), and true or false values known as Booleans.
A Boolean variable can only have a value of true or fa1se.
### Rules variable naming 
1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_).
2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_).
3. We cannot use keywords or reserved words.
4. All variables are case sensitive.
5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
6. Use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word when the variable has more than word.
### Decisions and Loops
Decision Making Flowcharts can help us plan for which lines of code should be run next. There are 2 components to a decision :
* An expression is evaluated , which return a value
* A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation
We evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what we expect it might to be. The result will be a Boolean (true or false).
